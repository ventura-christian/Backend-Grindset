# ðŸ’» Backend-Grindset

This repository serves as my personal development hub for backend web engineering.
Every line of code, whether a small script or a larger project, documents my progress toward mastering backend systems and becoming a professional backend developer.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus

Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in backend development by deepening my understanding of core technologies and tools:

- Python 3.11+: primary backend language and scripting foundation
- Git & GitHub: version control, branching, and collaborative workflows
- VS Code: development environment setup and extensions
- FastAPI: modern Python backend framework
- PostgreSQL: understanding relational databases
- Software Discipline: consistent coding habits, structured learning, and daily commits

## ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack & Topics

Guided by the [Backend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend), my learning is centered on:

- Languages: Python (core focus)
- Databases: PostgreSQL (basics)
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
- Core topics: Backend architecture, API design, database modeling, and software best practices

## ðŸ“œ Scripts & Projects

All learning artifacts, from small utilities to larger

- [Master Script Folder](https://github.com/ventura-christian/Backend-Grindset/tree/main/Scripts)

## ðŸ”„ Repository Updates

This repository evolves as I do and will be updated regularly with new scripts, refactored code, and improved implementations reflecting my growth in backend engineering
